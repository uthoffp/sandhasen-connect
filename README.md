### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure I've been using in this project. The lib folder contains the main code for the application. This project uses the MVVM Pattern.

```
lib/
|- data/
|- resources/
|- view/
|- viewmodel/
```

The lib directory contains the following structure:

```
1- data - This directory contaitains all data classes, the local database for offline usage and online db calls used by the application. The datasource subdirectory contains all db querys. Data classes are organised in the model subdirectory.
2- resources - All application level constants are defined in this directory within their respective files. 
3- viewmodel - Contains viewmodel for all ui screens.
4- view - Contains all the ui of the project, contains sub directory for each screen or fragment.
5- main.dart - This is the starting point for the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e firebase, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
